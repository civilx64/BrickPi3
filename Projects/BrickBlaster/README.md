BrickBlaster
============

## LEGO NXT project from [nxtprograms.com](http://nxtprograms.com/machine_gun/index.html)

## Building Instructions

The BrickBlaster can be built by following the instructions linked above.
Some customization is required to mount the BrickPi3 case, which is narrower than the LEGO NXT brick.
I did this on-the-fly and unfortunately did not save any sketches or notes about the specific modifications.

I also used a plug-in power brick to power the BrickPi hat.
The battery pack would work as well, but would need to be mounted on the blaster to accomodate mobile use.
(I never progressed past the first prototype, which was static mounted.)
